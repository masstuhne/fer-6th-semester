Today, I went to the market and bought a Banana. 
It looked so ripe and delicious.
Along with that, I also picked up some jagoda for a fruit salad I'm planning to make. 
As I walked past the fruit stands, I couldn't resist buying a dinja; its aroma was irresistible. 
The sun shone brightly as I walked through the park, enjoying the crisp morning air.
Afterward, I remembered I needed ingredients for a pie, so I grabbed a Jabuka.
Lastly, I spotted a huge lubenica and knew it would be perfect for refreshing smoothies during the hot summer days.
